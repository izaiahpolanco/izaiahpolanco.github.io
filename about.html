    <p id="bio"> My name is Izaiah Polanco. I am a full-time student at the University of Rhode Island, a full-time employee working with clients with disabilities, and a full-time father. My only child was born on <em><strong> December 25, 2022 </strong> at <strong>12:25am!</strong></em> Talk about a Christmas baby! 
    
    I love playing and watching sports. I'm a Chiefs (bandwagon Mahomes) fan and a Nuggets fan (non-bandwagon, '03 Melo). I love jigsaw puzzles, sudoku, and crosswords. Attending concerts and comedy shows are big hobbies of mine.
    More importantly, traveling is my absolute favorite. I'll utilize any excuse in the book to take a trip! </p>
